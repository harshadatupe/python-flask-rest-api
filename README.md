Developed REST APIs for an online retail platform in Python, Flask and Flask-SQLAlchemy, encompassing user authentication with token refresh, and CRUD API endpoints for managing stores and store items.

Engineered JWT blacklisting mechanisms to safeguard REST APIs from abuse and enforced seamless log-out procedures. Boosted API performance with task queues and background workers.

Implemented a CI/CD pipeline using GitLab CI, to automate the build and packaging process that employed Docker containerization.
